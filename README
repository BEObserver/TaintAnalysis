TAINT ANALYSIS FOR CUDA KERNELS

INSTALLATION:

This document is created based on the link: http://llvm.org/docs/Projects.html, 
if you have further questions, please refer to it for more information.

1. Place the TaintAnalysis directory under 'llvm/projects' 

2. Go into 'TaintAnalysis' directory, and run './configure --with-llvmsrc=<directory>'
command to configure

3. Run 'make' to build a shared library, and the shared library 
resides in the same directory as the source code


RUN:

The taint analyser consists of three llvm passes, which performs a combination of 
use-def chain analysis and alias analysis to perform taint analysis on CUDA kernels.

To run the analyser:

sesa < [input_llvm_bytecode] > [output_llvm_bytecode]

1. The taint analyser outputs informative messages on which variables shall 
be symbolized in a file named "summary.txt"

2. The taint analyser annotates the input llvm bytecode with LLVM metadata 
and generates the new llvm bytecode containing LLVM annotations that are used 
to prune redundant flows in the symbolic execution stage.
